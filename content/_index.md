This website is entirely dedicated to ObfusKey, a tiny piece of software representing a complete change of paradigm in seed-phrase storage.

## Browsing this website

In roughly 20 minutes of browsing the categories in their natural order (What, Why, How, How-to) you will get the whole picture including tutorials on how to install it safely and how to use it properly.

So, let's get started: [What is ObfusKey?](../1what)   
{{< /paige/center >}}

## TL;DR

If you don't have 20 minutes to spare, here is the TL;DR:

ObfusKey is a stand alone offline software that obfuscates your cryptocurrency wallet's seed phrase using a set of passwords you define.

There are no limitations in the number of passwords, their length or the characters they are made of.

The obfuscation is not reversible without these passwords.

Because of the algorythm, it is far more profitable for an attacker to randomly generate seed phrases than attempting to break the obfuscation.

The output is a text file that you can store online or print, both are equally as safe because the obfuscated seed phrase is inherently safe and inert.

To make it unbreakable, you have to tune-up the output by only disclosing a couple of characters per passwords and adding hints for each passwords that only you will understand.

ObfusKey is the best way to secure your lightweight wallet like Metamask and other that don't support passphrases but it can also be used to add a layer of security to your passphrase protected wallet.

Downloading it and executing it is very easy and it is designed to be run on safe OS like Tails Os.
